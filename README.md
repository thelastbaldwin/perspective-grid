## Perspective Grid

    A tool for creating 2 and 3 point perspective grid underlays

### Controls

 * cvpAngle - Center vanishing point vertical angle. Use this to ajust the 3rd vanishing point up and down when creating a 3-point pespective grid. 

 * vanishingPoints - Number of vanishing points (2 or 3)

 * FOV - Field of view. Determines the viewing angle for the grid (50 - 90deg, default 60)

 * rvpAngle - Right vanishing point angle relative to the middle of the frame. Set this to 0 or 90 to generate a 1-point perspective grid down the center of the frame. 

 * lvpAngle - Left vanishing point angle relative to the middle of the frame. This can't be adjusted and will stay relative to the right vanishing point by 90 degrees. 

 * horizon - Sets the vertical position of the horizon line. 

 * lineCount - Sets the number of lines radiating from the vanishing points

 * lineThickness - Sets the thickness of the lines radiating from the vanishing points. 

 ## Generating a Grid

 Adjust the controls to generate the grid to your liking. Adjust the size of the window to match the aspect ratio of your composition. Press `download` to download a jpg image of the grid. You can now print this and use tracing paper over it, or use the file in a program like photoshop.
